#### ***[ABOUT]***
This program arose from an idea of <a href="https://github.com/Chaika9">Chaika9</a>. A big thanks â™¡ï¼¾â–½ï¼¾â™¡.

<br>

#### ***[ðŸ‘Œ REQUIREMENTS]***
  + Java 7 or higher.
  
<br>
  
#### ***[ðŸ¤” HOW DOES IT WORK]***
  
<br>
  
***I. Windows:***
1. Download the Java Archive File and put it in a seperate folder so that you can find the output files with ease.
2. Then create a new batch file (*.bat) with the following content:

```sh
@echo off 
java -jar ${rasterizer-file-name-here}.jar
pause
```
3. Save all, and simply run the batch file.
4. If everything goes like the **"dev"** wanted, a file chooser will pop! Choose a *valid* (And what i do mean by valid is, a *.png, *.img file ... not a .. ehm ehm .. *.txt for instance) press Open/Ok and wait for some random magic/spels to occur. 
5. check the "out" folder and you will have a .txt file containing the raster's data ^^
